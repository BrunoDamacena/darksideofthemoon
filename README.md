# Dark Side of the Moon
I used C + OpenGL to make the Pink Floyd's Cover Album "Dark Side of the Moon".
The program draw the main triangle, the line, the triangle inside the main triangle and the rainbow with polygons

## How to Compile
First, you have to install the required libraries for OpenGL. On Linux Ubuntu/Mint, open the terminal and type:
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev

## How to execute
Open the terminal on the folder that have the makefile and the .c file. Type:
- `make` - Compile and make the executable;
- `make run` - Compile, make and run the executable;
- `make clean` - Erase all generated files.
